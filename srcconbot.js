There is much we've collectively learned over the course of nearly six years of maintaining the Texas Tribune's salary and prisoner databases. No matter how prepared you may be for the inevitable requests for exclusion, eventually there will be a request that causes you to pause and ask, \"wait, are we doing this right?\" What do you do when your established protocol is woefully inadequate for a person's request? When your news app puts you or your organization in the position of power, how do you ensure the humans in the data are treated with empathy? Our goal with this session is to encourage a dialog on and around these issues. We will go over our current policies, and share stories of what we've done well... and what we've done not so well.

It is frequently the case that data from our digital footprints is used to predict our behavior and make decisions about the choices available to us. This unprecedented capacity to collect and analyze data has brought along with it a troubling dismissiveness of user agency, participation, and ownership. Such systems assume that it is an acceptable by-product for their users to have no understanding of the decisions being made about them and no agency in that decision-making process. For the most part, the invisibilized nature of these decisions are seen as a feature, not a bug, of a good user experience. As we begin to use algorithmic decision-making in areas of our lives that are increasingly high-stakes, it is essential that we create and utilize processes that maintain user agency and understanding. In this session, participants will be imagining and designing user experiences that employ participatory algorithmic-decision making processes. The session will be open to folks from all experience levels.

But what exactly is audience development? How do you find these magical creatures? What do they do? And can they really help connect your journalism with more people? The simple answer is yes. If you do it right. FRONTLINE has had an audience development team for four years, and it has been transformative. We've learned that when our editorial and audience teams work side by side, hand in hand we CAN make magic together. We've seen double and triple digit growth across multiple platforms. But the process isn't always easy, pretty or comfortable. In this session we'll have an open and honest conversation about our lessons learned. We'll share stories of success and failures. And we'll offer practical advice and tips for people who work in traditional newsrooms -- and for traditional bosses uncomfortable with thinking about audience. We'd also open it up to the room to hear more about how other newsrooms are approaching this.",

Let's share examples of publishers making the most of this new creative format which demands a different story-telling style, combining text, animation and video. Optimising for this silent format is also a great reason to make your videos accessible through subtitles or closed-captions. Whether you're already captioning your videos or looking to get started let's go through recently developed tools for making this easier including crowdsourcing (Amara) and Speech To Text (Trint) and how you can integrate them into your workflows publishing on YouTube and Facebook.",

But newsrooms still can be old-school, so even if you write and deploy code, you still probably have some non-technical managers and peers. How do you help them better understand what you do? How can you work effectively together and stay on good terms? How do you pitch ideas to them, and how do they pitch ideas to you? How do you communicate about progress, priorities and problems, both on a daily basis and in a crisis? Let's talk about what's worked and what still needs improvement.",

As the tools we use for storytelling become not just more diverse but more constrained by the spectre of Terms Of Service, can we hedge our bets? Or to put it a different way, does our work to serve both third-party platforms and the websites that serve as our foundations actually constitute a zero-sum game? This session proposes that, by stepping back, we can imagine a workflow and toolset that serves both needs—and, by extension, newsrooms—even better than the current generation of content management systems. In order to investigate this approach, we will ask three questions: 1. Rather than abandon the benefits that the web affords us as a structure, how can we carry with us the ethos and process of the web as we negotiate these new platforms? 2. Can our industry call upon a history of standards and protocols to avoid partner lock-in? 3. Should our tools pivot from a focus on authorship to one of reportage and remixing, allowing us to use new platforms in focused ways without losing control over the source material? What if the web is the best idea? How can we retain the imperatives of the web as we serve the future of storytelling, and what are the kinds of tools and standards we can rally around to preserve that context while allowing us to experiment in other people's walled gardens?",
